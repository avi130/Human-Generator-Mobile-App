# Human-Generator-Mobile-App (using Flutter & Python) 
## Welcome to my scalable Deep Learning Mobile Application 
This app takes a Sketch of a Human and Generates a Realistic Image!  

To run the API(humanflask.py) via FLUTTER you need to run on anaconda :
activate ft
set FLASK_APP=humanflask.py  
set FLASK_ENV=development  
flask run --host=<<IP ADDRESS>>  

On the 'home' file you sould also change the ip address to yours.  
  
In the app there is a place for painting.
Each time whene the user lifts his finger off the screen the machine creates an image that simulates the drawing.  
The clearer and more detailed the drawing, the better the output.
